# How to contribute

_Note:_ For specifics on local development, please see the Development section of our [README](./README.md).

The AppInf team welcomes contributions to this project. We endeavor to make useful templates for developers at Procore, but as the scope of required service features expands, we anticipate the need for increased outside contributions where teams can offer specialized expertise.

Feel free to open a PR any time. If you do, please keep in mind that the `simple-backend-nest-service` is intended to be used as a template for teams looking to launch new services to production. In review, we look to verify that changes:

- Maintain or increase the ease with which teams can clone the repo and get started
- Are well documented, with an eye towards the developer experience.
- Changes are generalizable for all new service authors (vs being suited for a standalone prototype / example)

Also note that if you are using a PR to explore (or use as a sandbox), note that `#team-application-infrastructure` does not review PRs in a `Draft` state.

If feedback is desired, whether for work in flight or before you get started, please reach out to [#team-application-infrastructure](https://procoretech.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=C018R4BHW74).

If you encounter a bug or would like to request a feature please notify us in our team Slack channel, [#team-application-infrastructure](https://procoretech.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=C018R4BHW74).

When your changes are ready for review, un-Drafting your PR should automatically ping #team-application-infrastructure for a review as a CODEOWNER.
